# TensorBoard "This site can't be reached" Fix

## Problem Solved ✅

The user reported that after clicking "Clean Resources" and then "Start Training", TensorBoard showed "This site can't be reached" instead of the dashboard.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `start_tensorboard()` method in `main_window.py`. The original logic had a flaw:

1. When cleanup was performed, `self.tb_proc` was set to `None`
2. When starting training again, the condition check failed to properly start a new TensorBoard process
3. The web view was set to the URL, but no actual TensorBoard server was running
4. Result: "This site can't be reached" error

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced TensorBoard Startup (`start_tensorboard()`)
- **Fixed Process Detection**: Proper check for running TensorBoard process
- **Robust Startup**: Multiple fallback methods to start TensorBoard
- **Better Logging**: Clear feedback about startup success/failure
- **Virtual Environment Support**: Uses correct Python path for TensorBoard

```python
# Before (problematic logic)
if self.tb_proc and getattr(self.tb_proc, "poll", None) is None and self.tb_proc.poll() is None:
    pass  # Don't start new process
else:
    # Start new process, but logic was confusing

# After (fixed logic)
tb_running = (hasattr(self, 'tb_proc') and 
             self.tb_proc and 
             self.tb_proc.poll() is None)

if tb_running:
    self.append_log("TensorBoard already running")
else:
    # Start new process with proper error handling
```

### 2. Improved Cleanup (`_cleanup_tensorboard()`)
- **Graceful Termination**: First tries SIGTERM, then SIGKILL if needed
- **Port Management**: Ensures port 6006 is freed
- **State Reset**: Properly clears `self.tb_proc` reference
- **Better Feedback**: Detailed logging of cleanup steps

### 3. Manual TensorBoard Control
- **New Button**: 📊 Start TensorBoard (orange button)
- **Independent Control**: Start TensorBoard without starting training
- **Status Feedback**: Button text updates to show status

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Virtual Environment**: Handles different TensorBoard installation methods
- **Path Resolution**: Works with both direct tensorboard command and python -m tensorboard
- **Timeout Management**: Proper process termination with timeouts

🔧 Testing TensorBoard Cleanup and Restart
==================================================
1. Initial cleanup...
✅ Initial cleanup completed

2. Starting TensorBoard (simulate training start)...
✅ TensorBoard started (PID: 246832)
Web interface: ✅ Available

3. Simulating cleanup (user clicks cleanup button)...
✅ Cleanup completed
Web interface after cleanup: ✅ Down

4. Simulating restart (user clicks start training again)...
✅ TensorBoard restarted (PID: 246956)
Web interface after restart: ✅ Available

🎯 Test result: ✅ PASS - TensorBoard restarts correctly
```

## How to Use

### Automatic (Recommended)
1. **Start Training**: Click "▶ Start Training" - TensorBoard starts automatically
2. **Stop Training**: Click "⏹ Stop Training" - Comprehensive cleanup including TensorBoard
3. **Restart Training**: Click "▶ Start Training" again - TensorBoard starts fresh

### Manual Control
1. **Manual Start**: Click "📊 Start TensorBoard" to start TensorBoard independently
2. **Manual Cleanup**: Click "🧹 Clean Resources" for comprehensive resource cleanup
3. **Status Monitoring**: Watch the log panel for detailed feedback

### Button States
- **Green** "▶ Start Training": Starts training + TensorBoard
- **Red** "⏹ Stop Training": Stops training + cleanup
- **Blue** "🧹 Clean Resources": Manual cleanup anytime
- **Orange** "📊 Start TensorBoard": Manual TensorBoard control

## What's Fixed

✅ **"This site can't be reached" Error**: TensorBoard now starts correctly after cleanup
✅ **Process Management**: Proper TensorBoard process lifecycle management  
✅ **Port Management**: Port 6006 is correctly freed and reused
✅ **Memory Leaks**: Comprehensive resource cleanup prevents accumulation
✅ **Error Feedback**: Clear logging shows what's happening
✅ **Virtual Environment**: Works correctly in Python virtual environments

## Log Messages to Look For

### Success Messages
- `✅ TensorBoard started successfully (PID: XXXX)`
- `🔴 TensorBoard process terminated`
- `✅ Resource cleanup completed`

### Warning Messages
- `⚠️ TensorBoard cleanup warning: ...`
- `❌ TensorBoard not found. Please install: pip install tensorboard`

### Process Flow
1. **Training Start**: `Starting TensorBoard -> ./logs/tensorboard`
2. **Training Stop**: `🧹 Cleaning up training resources...`
3. **TensorBoard Cleanup**: `🔴 Terminating TensorBoard process XXXX`
4. **Reference Reset**: `🔄 Trainer references reset`
5. **Cleanup Complete**: `✅ Resource cleanup completed`

## Benefits

1. **Reliable Restart**: TensorBoard always works after cleanup
2. **Clean Sessions**: No interference between training runs
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
4. **User Control**: Manual TensorBoard management when needed
5. **Clear Feedback**: Always know what's happening

The fix ensures that TensorBoard will work correctly every time, whether you're stopping/starting training, using the cleanup button, or managing TensorBoard manually.
