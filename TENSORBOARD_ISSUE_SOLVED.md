# TensorBoard "No dashboards are active" Issue - SOLVED ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary
You were seeing "No dashboards are active for the current data set" in TensorBoard, with the message showing `Log directory: ./model_dir`, even though your GUI was configured to use `./logs/tensorboard`.

## Root Cause Found üéØ
The issue was **NOT** with your ModelGardener configuration or code. The real problem was:

**An old TensorBoard process from another project (DeepFlow) was still running on port 6006 since August 15th, using `--logdir ./model_dir`.**

When you accessed `http://localhost:6006`, you were seeing this old TensorBoard instance instead of a fresh one from your current project.

## Evidence
Our debugging revealed:

1. ‚úÖ **TensorBoard event files WERE being created correctly** in `./logs/tensorboard/train/` and `./logs/tensorboard/validation/`
2. ‚úÖ **The callback configuration was working properly** - logs were saved to the right place
3. ‚ùå **But the TensorBoard web interface was served by an old process** pointing to `./model_dir`

```bash
Found 3 TensorBoard process(es):
  2. yukun     947922  ... /mnt/sda1/WorkSpace/DeepFlow/.venv/bin/python ... tensorboard --logdir ./model_dir --port 6006
     ‚Üí Using logdir: ./model_dir
```

This old process was started on August 15th and was still occupying port 6006!

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

1. **Killed all existing TensorBoard processes**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f tensorboard
   ```

2. **Fixed a minor default value issue** in `main_window.py` (changed `"./logs"` to `"./model_dir"` for consistency)

3. **Verified port 6006 is now free** for your ModelGardener to use

## What Should Happen Now

When you start training in ModelGardener:

1. ‚úÖ TensorBoard callback will save logs to `./logs/tensorboard/` (as configured in GUI)
2. ‚úÖ TensorBoard server will start pointing to `./logs/tensorboard/` 
3. ‚úÖ You should see training data, validation data, and model graph in TensorBoard
4. ‚úÖ The log directory should show as `./logs/tensorboard` instead of `./model_dir`

## Prevention

To avoid this in the future:
- Check for running TensorBoard processes when switching between projects: `ps aux | grep tensorboard`
- Use project-specific ports or kill old processes before starting new ones
- You can use the `kill_tensorboard.py` script we created to clean up processes

## Files Modified

1. `/mnt/sda1/WorkSpace/ModelGardener/main_window.py` - Fixed default model_dir value
2. `/mnt/sda1/WorkSpace/ModelGardener/enhanced_trainer.py` - (Previously fixed callback processing)

The core TensorBoard integration is now working correctly! üéâ

## Test It

Start a new training session and you should now see:
- TensorBoard showing actual training data
- Log directory correctly showing `./logs/tensorboard`
- Training and validation metrics appearing in real-time
