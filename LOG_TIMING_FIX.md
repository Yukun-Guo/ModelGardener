# Log Timing Fix Summary

## Issue
The log tag (log widget) in the ModelGardener GUI was not updating training information in real-time. Users were experiencing delays in seeing training progress, batch updates, and other important information during model training.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by several factors:
1. **Thread Communication Delays**: Signals between the training thread and UI thread were not properly prioritized
2. **UI Update Bottlenecks**: The log widget was not being refreshed immediately when new logs arrived
3. **No Periodic UI Refresh**: The UI was only updated when signals arrived, with no periodic refresh mechanism
4. **Suboptimal Batch Logging Frequency**: Training progress was only logged every 10 batches, causing gaps in real-time feedback

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Signal Connection (`main_window.py`)
```python
# Before: Default signal connection
BRIDGE.log.connect(self.append_log)

# After: Thread-safe queued connection
BRIDGE.log.connect(self.append_log, Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection)
```

### 2. Improved Log Append Method (`main_window.py`)
```python
def append_log(self, text):
    ts = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    if hasattr(self, 'log_edit') and self.log_edit is not None:
        self.log_edit.appendPlainText(f"[{ts}] {text}")
        # NEW: Force immediate UI update
        self.log_edit.repaint()
        # NEW: Auto-scroll to show latest entries
        scrollbar = self.log_edit.verticalScrollBar()
        scrollbar.setValue(scrollbar.maximum())
        # NEW: Process pending events immediately
        from PySide6.QtCore import QCoreApplication
        QCoreApplication.processEvents()
```

### 3. Periodic UI Refresh Timer (`main_window.py`)
```python
# Setup refresh timer in __init__
self.ui_refresh_timer = QTimer()
self.ui_refresh_timer.timeout.connect(self._refresh_ui_during_training)
self.ui_refresh_timer.setSingleShot(False)
self.ui_refresh_timer.setInterval(100)  # Refresh every 100ms during training

def _refresh_ui_during_training(self):
    """Periodic UI refresh during training to ensure responsiveness."""
    try:
        from PySide6.QtCore import QCoreApplication
        QCoreApplication.processEvents()
        # Also ensure log widget stays scrolled to bottom
        if hasattr(self, 'log_edit') and self.log_edit is not None:
            scrollbar = self.log_edit.verticalScrollBar()
            if scrollbar.value() > scrollbar.maximum() - 50:
                scrollbar.setValue(scrollbar.maximum())
    except Exception as e:
        pass  # Don't let UI refresh errors interrupt training
```

### 4. Timer Management in Training Methods
```python
def start_training(self):
    # ... existing code ...
    # NEW: Start UI refresh timer during training
    if hasattr(self, 'ui_refresh_timer'):
        self.ui_refresh_timer.start()

def stop_training(self):
    # NEW: Stop UI refresh timer when training stops
    if hasattr(self, 'ui_refresh_timer') and self.ui_refresh_timer.isActive():
        self.ui_refresh_timer.stop()
    # ... existing code ...

def on_training_finished(self):
    # NEW: Stop UI refresh timer when training finishes
    if hasattr(self, 'ui_refresh_timer') and self.ui_refresh_timer.isActive():
        self.ui_refresh_timer.stop()
    # ... existing code ...
```

### 5. Increased Batch Logging Frequency (`enhanced_trainer.py`)
```python
# Before: Log every 10 batches
qt_callback = QtBridgeCallback(total_train_steps=total_steps, log_every_n=10)

# After: Log every 5 batches for better real-time feedback
qt_callback = QtBridgeCallback(total_train_steps=total_steps, log_every_n=5)
```

## Benefits
1. **Real-time Log Updates**: Training information now appears immediately in the log widget
2. **Smooth UI Responsiveness**: The interface remains responsive during training
3. **Better Progress Visibility**: More frequent batch updates provide better feedback
4. **Thread-Safe Communication**: Proper signal handling prevents UI freezing
5. **Auto-Scrolling**: Latest log entries are automatically visible
6. **Resource Management**: Timer properly stopped when training ends

## Testing
A test script (`test_log_timing.py`) was created to verify the improvements work correctly by simulating rapid logging scenarios.
