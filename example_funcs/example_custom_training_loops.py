"""
Example custom training loop functions for ModelGardener

This file demonstrates how to create custom training loop functions and classes that can be
dynamically loaded into the ModelGardener application. Training loops can be either:

1. Functions that implement custom training logic
2. Classes that provide comprehensive training functionality

For functions:
- Should accept parameters like model, optimizer, loss, data, epochs, etc.
- Should implement the complete training loop logic
- Should handle both training and validation phases

For classes:
- Should implement training-related methods
- Can have __init__ method with configuration parameters
- Should provide methods like train(), fit(), step(), etc.
